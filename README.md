This project combines ATR-FTIR technique and some basic machine learning algorithms to achieve quick and indirect characterization of biomass wastes. Paper URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.121723

List of contents:
  SVR-single      using just SVR algorithm to achieve indirect characterization  
  SVR-combined    using SVC and SVR algorithms to achieve indirect characterization  
  SVR-pca         using PCA, SVC, and SVR algorithms to achieve indirect characterization  
  SVR-mechanism   the model is just the same as SVR-PCA, but it involves some modifications to the training set and test set
