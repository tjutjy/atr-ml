# atr-ml
This project combines ATR-FTIR technique and some basic machine learning algorithms to achieve quick and indirect characterization of biomass wastes. The code might seem confusing if the reader has not read the relevant paper. The link of relevant paper would be mentioned after the paper is accepted. Currentlt this project just works as a intermediate for the code.

List of contents:
  SVR-single      using just SVR algorithm to achieve indirect characterization
  SVR-combined    using SVC and SVR algorithms to achieve indirect characterization
  SVR-pca         using PCA, SVC, and SVR algorithms to achieve indirect characterization
  SVR-mechanism   the model is just the same as SVR-PCA, but it involves some modifications to the training set and test set
